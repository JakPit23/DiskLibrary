DLFC Parser (next time only parser) is very simple and easy to use.
Parser has only one public function ParseFile() with one parameter path, which is string.
!!! Path must be specified, if it is used for one file manually, in this format C:\\path\\path\\file.dlfc.
You need to use double backslash (\\) or double slash (//) because of C#
