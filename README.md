# DiskLibrary

DiskLibrary is simple software for loading data from old CDs and DVDs.

## What does it mean?
You have some CDs at home, haven‘t you? And they aren‘t used anymore. Number of players, TVs or other devices, which can play data from this type of disks aren‘t so popular anymore. And what can you do about this? You can copy data from it manually and risk loss of data. I am not talking about creating new folders, naming, date of creation and so. Or you can use DiskLibrary. With simple wizard, you can load all of your disks on one place, where they will be secure and without risk of data corruption.

## What can you do with?
You can load data manually or automatically. With automatic loading, you only select the disk and software will load all the metadata as name, description, cover image, if it has one, date of original creation and so. Or you can do it manually, you select disk, enter info and software will handle copying data and pairing it with the info. When you have disks loaded, you can view it on Main Page, where you can edit metadata, delete data or view it in file explorer.

## How can I get this software?
You can download from Github and install it with setup.exe The installation wizard is simple and you can have software installed in few minutes.

NOTE: The installator is not ready now, because I am developing dependencies for main program. You can only download .rar with all the files. With next release it will be .zip and I will include more things
